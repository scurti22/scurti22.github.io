</header>

<main> 
    <p>HTTP was created along with three other building blocks. 
        HTML was created to represent hypertext documents, WorldWideWeb to display and edit,
         and httpd which gives access to the document. HTTP’s place was to exchange documents.
          HTTP was termed the one-line protocol.  The one-line protocol consisted of a single line, for example 
          “get / my-page.html”. Using this protocol had its downsides as it could only transmit HTML files.  
          With no status or error codes, it created HTML files with a description of the issue. </p>
