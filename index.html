        <p>  <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> or <strong>HTTP</strong> is a protocol made to fetch resources.<lb>
         Known as the foundation of any data exchange. Considering that <strong>HTTP</strong> is a client-server protocol, </lb>
         requests are sent by the client which is then sent to a server which then responds. With proxies
          in between that help to pass on the request.  Since its creation in 1989 <strong>HTTP</strong> has gone through several
           changes to get to how we know it today.</p>
           <p>This website will explore the history of HTTP as well as the evolution of the World Wide Web that came from it.</p>
